**Florian W. Leskovsek** or simply **Leskov**, also known by the name **Leskodamus** on the web, is a {{< age >}} year old Software Developer from Vorarlberg, Austria. After graduating as a Network Engineer at the HTL Dornbirn in Vorarlberg with a grade of 1.2 (Austrian grading system), Leskov proceeded his education at the IT College Imst in Tyrol. There he graduated with a grade of 1.28 in the written matriculation and diploma examination.

After completing the 9 months long Austrian civilian service, Leskov immediately after started his full-time position as a Software Develoepr at [Angelbird](https://www.angelbird.com/) in Dornbirn, Austria in October 2023. At this company, he is reponsible for the development and maintanance of the internal libraries and applications - using languages like Python, C/C++ and Go. He's been there ever since and is ready to take on new challenges for the years to come.

## Leskov's Education

### Diploma Thesis 2022

> IT College Imst - Software Engineering

Our team of four developed a streaming deck called "Smart Stream" :keyboard:, a touch display connected to a Raspberry Pi that allows users to perform various tasks on their computer — such as executing scripts or sending keystrokes — with a single button press. We also integrated support for OBS via the OBS-WebSocket API. The user interface is built entirely in PHP, enabling the "Smart Stream" to run on almost any device with a web browser. A management tool, developed in Python with a PyQt GUI, facilitates the connection between the computer and the "Smart Stream" device. The tool supports both Windows 10/11 and Linux platforms. However, it's important to note that no security features, such as encrypted sockets, were implemented due to time constraints, so hardening was not fully addressed.

### Technical School Thesis 2020

> HTL Dornbirn - Focus on Network Engineering

For our graduation project at HTL Dornbirn, my teammates and I developed an automated greenhouse designed for growing small plants. It had been given the name "BioPi" as it was built with a Raspberry Pi as the main component. Users could manage the greenhouse through a web interface, allowing them to create templates specifying watering schedules and the duration of LED lighting. Sensors monitored soil moisture, air temperature, and humidity to automate the process. The project’s codebase has since been archived and is no longer publicly accessible. Why? Because the code was utter garbage! :shit:

### What else?

I love creating things, and programming has been the best way for me to do just that. Write some code, apply logic, compile, execute — and watch it work its magic. Whether it's printing some lorem ipsum on the terminal or generating a Mandelbrot set, it's always exciting! I’ve particularly enjoyed coding in C/C++ and Rust so far, but have also have been having a great experience with Go so far. As long as the language is statically typed, I will like it :smile: 

On top of programming, I have a deep passion for the Linux :penguin: operating system. I've been using (Arch) Linux as my daily driver for years now, and I wouldn't dream of going back to Windows. Even gaming on Linux these days is mostly smooth, and in some cases, games perform better than on Windows.

However, I am that type of person that needs constant change - maybe one day I'll become a full Apple user, or switch over to a BSD system, or instead of programming, I'll become a gardener? Who knows.

Further, I like to push to my limits, mentally and phisically. Not giving up - never. Do it. Again. And again. And again.
